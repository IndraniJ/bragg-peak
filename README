This demo program computes the dose-depth profile of protons in water

-A water tub of dimenstions 5 x 5 x 30 cm in kept inside a world volume with a size slightly bigger than the water tub (factor 1.2)
-Protons are shot from one end of the water tub
-The proton-dose-score.mac file creates a Box scoring volume (energyDeposit) of similar size of the water tub with binning along z to be 300 corresponding to 1 mm. The bins along x and y are set to 1.
-The mac file also dumps the energyDeposit parameter at all bins at the end of the run. The mac file has the setting for Beam energy and number of particles.

-On a system where Geant4 is setup, one can compile the file and run two modes:
-non-interactive mode: ./exampleB1.out proton-dose-score.mac in which case a file (whose name can be set in the proton-dose-score.mac) is created at the end of the run. No visualization is shown in this case
-interactive mode: ./exampleB1.out. The visualization shows up and one can run the command /control/execute proton-dose-score.mac within it. However, one has to comment the /run/numberOfThreads 4 command in proton-dose-score.mac before that
-- Also for every run the scoring mesh name has to be changed in this case.

-- There is a file called dose-depth.py which can be used to plot the content of the output file to see the Bragg-peak.
