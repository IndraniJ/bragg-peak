This demo program computes the dose-depth profile of protons in water

-A water tub of dimenstions 5 x 5 x 30 cm in kept inside a world volume with a size slightly bigger than the water tub (factor 1.2)
-A scoring volume with a size similar to the water tub is also created with a 300 bins along z and 1 bin along x any y is created
-Protons are shot from one end of the water tub
- On a system where Geant4 is setup:
- Compile the code and run ./exampleB1 4 100 10000
- The above command will shoot 10000 protons of energy 100 MeV using 4 threads
- At the end of the run, the contents of the scoring volume are dumped to a file with a name energy-MEV-events-EVTS.txt
-- There is a file called dose-depth.py which can be used to plot the content of the output file to see the Bragg-peak.
